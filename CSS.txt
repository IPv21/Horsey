content>padding>border>margin border is visible rectangle around content area

static position--left of box, centered north n south, flush against the side

position: relative 
left : 200px -->relative to static position. left>right, top^bottom -inverted

position: absolute -->will cover text, can stack elements
top: 50px;
right: 100px;
50 from top, 200 FROM right

/* Fixed positioning */ relative to screen view, not box.
can make ti stay at the bottom of screen at all times
#fixed-box {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0; --->0 from bottom, 0 from right

Media Queries
common practice that they are always at the bottom
/* Tablets - header changes color */
@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  header {
    background: #772014;
  }
}

when im on screen, and when max width below 992, THEN bg color

@media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
  .card {
    width: 50%;
}
this made the images take up half the column instead of the whole line. there were four images in a row, below 992, two in a row.
normally 100%. makes the images take up 100 % of space. after, splits it in half. 

FLEXBOX
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries
distribute space dynamically as the screen changes

main {
  /* Turns this element into a flexbox */
  display: flex;
  /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin-top: 2%;
}

.card {
  /* A flex-basis of 200px sets the starting width */
  /* A flex-grow value of 1 allows the elements to evenly grow to fill the remaining space */
*/flex-groow flex-shrink flex-basis(MINIMUM SIZE)
  flex: 1 0 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  text-align: center;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
}

.card.camera {
  /* With a flex-grow value of 2, this element grows twice as wide as others */
  /* The second value, flex-shrink, defines how the element will shrink if it can't fit */
  flex: 2 1 200px;
}

align-items: center --adjust north and south

flex-direction: row -- puts em in a row

if a change isn't taking effect, start at its's parent
