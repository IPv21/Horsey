This seemed rather daunting at first. THere's a lot of stuff on the HTML page. CSS isn't any better. However, after breaking it down into smaller sections it begins to seem more manageable. That's the 
first step. Focus on the process, not the result. My motivation for this project and all that will follow lies in my desire to continue challenging myself instead of coming up with excuses why I can't 
do things. We already learn most of what we need to know to complete this. A little research and teamwork will take care of the rest. 
This project is apparently an example of a real world problem that will be encounted early in our coding careers. It is vital to master these steps before proceeding onto more complex problems. If 
I am unable to complete this I will need to seriously go back over the material and take better notes. 
Companies need to keep their websites and apps accessable to individuals with disabilities not only for moral and legal purposes, but it's great business wise also. If yours is the only website that
is easily accessable for those who are visually impared you're going to generate more revenue. 
The main thing I learned so far is how to add image alts in CSS. There are a few different ways to do it. Some easier than others. I'm sure they will all be usefull eventually. 
I doubt this project will stand out from the others. I don't think it's supposed to. I just hope it's right.
